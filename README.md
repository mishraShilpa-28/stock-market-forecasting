Stock Market Forecasting using Stacked LSTM (Deep Learning)
Overview
This project utilizes a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to predict stock prices. The model is trained on historical stock market data and forecasts future prices based on past trends.

Features
Uses Stacked LSTM for time series forecasting

Data preprocessing, including normalization and scaling

Visualization of stock trends and predictions

Evaluation metrics for model performance

Dataset
The project uses stock market data stored in AAPL.csv. The dataset includes:

Date

Open, High, Low, Close prices

Volume

Installation & Setup

Model Architecture
Input Layer: Takes historical stock price data

Stacked LSTM Layers: Extract temporal dependencies

Dense Layer: Outputs the predicted stock price

Usage
Load historical stock data

Train the LSTM model

Visualize predictions vs. actual stock prices

Use the model to forecast future stock trends

Results
The model successfully predicts future trends based on historical data, providing valuable insights for stock market analysis.
